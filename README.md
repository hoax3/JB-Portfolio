# Welcome to my Portfolio
Finally got around to making this. It took much longer than I initially thought. Guess I was having fun with it. Anywho, I made this project with the idea of following enterprise standards (TypeScript, React Router, traditional CSS) in order to prove my understanding of these fundamentals. Feel free to fork this. 

#### Technology

Built with React TS using Vite. Hosting will be done on AWS and I will create a blog post soon walking through AWS Amplify.
